## About this course

You will expand your current knowledge of Git and GitHub to help your research be more collaborative, reproducible, and transparent. You will learn how to develop your work independently on a “branch” before “merging” it back to a shared repository, and resolve any conflicts along the way. Then, you will learn about the pull request model of collaboration on GitHub and how to conduct code reviews.
