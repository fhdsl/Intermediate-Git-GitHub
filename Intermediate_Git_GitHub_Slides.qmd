## Intermediate Git and GitHub

## Introductions

-   Who am I?

. . .

-   What is DaSL?

. . .

-   Who are you?

    -   Name, pronouns, group you work in

    -   What brought you here?

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- **Make** commits in a local repository via the command line
- **Make** pushes and pulls to a remote GitHub repository via the command line
- **Make** branches and perform pull requests with the command line



## Git, notoriously

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

. . .

Let's master the basics!

## Review Git's Data Model

What's a **repository** (also known as **repo**)?

. . .

What's a **commit**?

. . .

What's a **branch**?

. . .

What's a **merge** or **pull request**?

## Git's Data Model

. . .

-   Git keeps track of a project within a designated directory, which is called a **repository** (also known as **repo**).

. . .

-   You can save the state of your repository by making a **commit**: Git will save the repository's **directory tree**, a link to the previous commit, and metadata.

. . .

## Branching and Merging

. . .


```         
o <-- o <-- o <-- o
```

. . .

**Branching**: when branching commit paths are created.

```         
o <-- o <-- o <-- o
            ^
             \
              --- o <-- o
```


. . .

**Merging**: when two branches are integrated together. This sometimes require careful communication, and this is done in GitHub via a **"pull request".**

```         
o <-- o <-- o <-- o <---- o
            ^            /
             \          v
              --- o <-- o
```




## Setup

```
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "username"
gh auth login
```

. . .

```         
? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com
? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS
? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? Yes
? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser
```

You will be given a code, and you will provide that code to GitHub via <https://github.com/login/device>.

## Cloning a repository

`git clone https://github.com/fhdsl/Intermediate_Git_GitHub_Student_Practice.git`

. . .

`cd Intermediate_Git_GitHub_Student_Practice`



## Git status

We look at our repository's status:

```         
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Git's Staging Model

. . .

Once Git **tracks** your file, it can have 3 possible states:

. . .

-   **Modified** means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your local repository yet.

. . .

-   **Staged** means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit.

. . .

-   **Committed** means that the data is safely stored in your local repository.

. . .

Why offer this intermediate staging ground?

. . .

-   Temporary or sensitive files

-   Not ready for a commit yet

## Making your first commit

. . .

Create a file:

```         
touch chris.txt
```

```         
git status

On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    chris.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

. . .

Take it from **untracked** to **staged**.

```         
git add chris.txt

git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
    new file:   chris.txt
```

. . .

**Commit** it with a message:

```         
git commit -m "added chris.txt"
[main 31f7b15] added chris.txt
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 chris.txt
```

## Staging model

## Practice!

-   Make some changes and make another commit by yourself.



## Staging model continued

## Updating the remote GitHub repo

The command `git push` will put your local repository on the remote repository.

. . .

```         
~/IntroGitDaSL/Collaborative_Git_GitHub_Student_Practice$ git push
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 313 bytes | 313.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.
To https://github.com/fhdsl/Collaborative_Git_GitHub_Student_Practice.git
   6e97634..0c82b47  main -> main
```

. . .

If the remote repository has been updated, you will have to run `git pull` before you can run `git push`.

## Branching and Merging

. . .

Linear:

```         
o <-- o <-- o <-- o
```

. . .

Branching:

```         
o <-- o <-- o <-- o
            ^
             \
              --- o <-- o
```

. . .

Branching and Merging:

```         
o <-- o <-- o <-- o <---- o
            ^            /
             \          v
              --- o <-- o
```


## Creating a branch on the remote

![](images/git_branch.png)

## Making changes to this new branch locally

The branch `clo2_development` is created on the remote, but it hasn't been updated locally. We run `git pull` locally to update it and switch to that branch via `git checkout`.

. . .

```         
% git pull
From https://github.com/fhdsl/S2_Collaborative_Git_GitHub_Student_Practice
 * [new branch]      clo2_development -> origin/clo2_development
Already up to date.

% git checkout clo2_development
Branch 'clo2_development' set up to track remote branch 'clo2_development' from 'origin'.
Switched to a new branch 'clo2_development'
```

. . .

We can use `git checkout main` to look switch back to our main branch. We can also use `git branch` to see the branches on a repository.

## Making changes to new branch

. . .

Edit the file that is unique to you.

```         
% git add chris.txt
% git commit -m "Edited chris.txt"
% git push
```

. . .

When you have pushed changes to the branch, you will see an option to *"Compare & pull request"*. Click on it.

## Pull request model

A **pull request** is a way to propose changes from a branch before it is merged back into the main repository.

. . .

This is commonly used in collaborative work in which a branch needs to be approved by other members on the team before it is integrated into the main project.

## Creating a pull request

You will see that you are trying to merge `clo2_development` into `main` on the remote. It also requires you to write a description of what you did on your branch.

## Appendix: A Pull Request with conflicts

-   Everyone create a new branch

-   I'll modify `README.md` on the main branch

-   You make changes to `README.md` on your branch, and make a Pull Request

-   What to do with a conflict?

## Appendix: Undoing

### Unstage a file

Suppose you staged a file, and then realized you don’t want the file to be staged for the commit. To unstage the file so that it returns to “modified”, run `git restore --staged [fileName]`

### Unmodify a file

After your commit, you make some new changes to a file so that it is “modified” You realized that you are no longer interested in this modification and want to un-modify it back to the last commit. Run: `git restore [fileName]`.

Warning: This cannot be undone!

### Revert a commit

After several commits, you realized that you wanted to undo a specific commit. Run: `git revert [commit identifier]`. This will undo that commit. However, if the content of that commit has experienced intermediate changes, it will raise a conflict.

You can find the “commit identifier” via `git log` to see your commit history.

### Reset to a previous commit
To “time-travel” back to a previous commit, run: `git reset --hard [commit identifier]`.

You can find the “commit identifier” via `git log` to see your commit history.

Warning: This cannot be undone!
